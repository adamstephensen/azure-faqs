## Why is App Insights awesome ? 

### App Insights is a one-stop stop for what's going on in your app
When you used to build an app, you could just go to IIS or to a log file to find out what was going on. With Microservices, serverless and modern architectures applications are distributed across many components. The server / vm / container that generated an error may not even be provisioned any more. App Insights is the central location to go to for everything that has happened to your app.

### App insights let's you fix bugs and performance issues before users even report them.
This is a big deal. Before centralised logging you waited for users to tell you about bugs, then you had to try and repo them… and then work out what the cause is. App Insights sits there monitoring your app and you get presented with anything that goes wrong, where it went wrong and what the user was doing… all before they report it. (For swallowed exceptions.. They may not even realise that something had gone wrong !)

### App Insights helps you make decisions 
Decisions about where to invest in a project are often made on 'gut feel' of what features are being used. App insights provides metrics on user behaviour that allow for better decision making

### App Insights Saves you money
The cloud is all about pay for use - in the old days you bought a server, and whether it was running at 10% utilisation or 60% you paid the same amount. The cloud rewards optimised applications.
