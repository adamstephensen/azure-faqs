## Questions I ask myself about a talk
- Who is the audience


## The talk structures I like 

### Business Focused talk
- Pain or the opportunity.. it's about getting them to put their phone down and engage
- Paint them a picture of how good the world can. 
- What's next

### War Stories Talk 
- Pain or the opportunity.. it's about getting them to put their phone down and engage
- Paint them a picture of how good the world can. 
- Talk about the implementation *not step by step*
  - what was the biggest lessons learnt
  - what was hard
  - whhat do i know now i wish i had known when i started.
  - what tools can get me up and going
  - where do i go for info on how to get going
  - where am i going next
- What's next  
  
## A-Points
The second slide of every one of my slide decks is my 'A-Points'.
They are the elevator pitch overview of your talk. ie. the key take aways.
They help focus the structure for the talk as you are writing it.

### Sample A-Points from my Bot Talk
1. **Bots are the next generation of UI.** 
  Customers are going to expect a first class conversational experience. Organisations are going to leverage bots to save money and improve customers satisfaction
2. **Bots are driven by AI. Leveraging AI in any app today is much easier than you would think.**
3. **The Bot UI is only a small part of the solution.** 
  UIs evolve. You need a maintainable, enterprise API to back your bot.
4. **There are going to be an amazing number of terrible bots.** 
  Get help designing and architecting your first few bots â€“ tech help, and design help.
5. **The future, even just the predictable future is astounding.**
