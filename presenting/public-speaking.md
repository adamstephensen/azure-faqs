## Questions I ask myself about a talk
- Who is the audience
- 

## The talk structures I like 

** Business Focused talk
- Pain or the opportunity.. it's about getting them to put their phone down
- Paint them a picture of how good the world can. 


** War Stories Talk **
- Talk about the implementation *not step by step*
  - what was the biggest lessons learnt
  - what was hard
  - whhat do i know now i wish i had known when i started.
  - what tools can get me up and going
  - where do i go for info on how to get going
  - where am i going next
