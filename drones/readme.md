## How does my drone interact with Azure AI Services ? 
```
With this SDK, we now have three methods to enable Azure AI services to interact with drone imagery and video in real-time:

Drone imagery can be sent directly to Azure for processing by an AI workload.
Drone imagery can be processed on Windows running Azure IoT Edge with an AI workload.
Drone imagery can be processed directly onboard drones running Azure IoT Edge with an AI workload.
