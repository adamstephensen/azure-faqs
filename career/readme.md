I've put together a few getting started with your career resources.

My #1 tip is get involved in the community.
There are free events happening in cities all over the world that are full of people like you, that love to help people in the same way that they were helped when they started.

Yes... If you are shy, or awkward or introverted this can be hard at first but I promise you'll find friendly people just like you at these events that will love helping you with your career.
