# Azure Cloud Workshop - Integration

Brisbane - 09 December | 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM | Microsoft Brisbane, Level 28, 400 George St, Brisbane, QLD 4000

Unlike other problems and solutions, integration is unique in that every scenario is different. But believe it or not, businesses of all different sizes  face the same questions - “How do we build an enterprise integration ecosystem in a cost-effective, simple and resilient manner?" and "How do we enable 1st and 3rd party teams to seamlessly integrate with our business?”. Thankfully, we can identify and architect certain patterns and practices to make this a smooth experience, delivering value in a very fast manner.

Please join us for a 1-day, heavily practical architecture and whiteboard design workshop including private consultation with Azure integration experts. You will gain a thorough understanding of how you can quickly use the best integration tools to solve your business challenges.

#### Workshop Information:

By the end of the day, attendees will have a thorough understanding of how to approach an integration design, as well as answered questions they have about their existing business.


#### Whiteboard scenarios

The second whiteboard scenario will be designed by you and your teams; this means you will get the opportunity to bring your current business requirements, issues, queries or architecture questions and get on-the-spot advice from an expert (as well as other attendees). This means you must have a think about this beforehand and bring these topics.

#### Who should attend:

This invitation is open to your architects, application development,engineering and integration teams.

#### What to bring
